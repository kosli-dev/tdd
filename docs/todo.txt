# Core
Add simple .github workflow to run unit and system tests
  This is proving tricky. On github there is a permission issue
  for the coverage/system/ dir. Perhaps the container could be
  created with --detach (and no --rm), the coverage files written
  to /tmp/coverage/system/, and then tar-piped to the host's
  coverage/system/ dir?

Add system APP test that posts scores form
Add pytest command line flag for grep-match in test docstring
Collect coverage of system tests themselves
   Will require coverage combine on the .coverage files from _two_ containers
Run unit tests in parallel and run coverage combine

# Maybe?
Add separate env-files for unit/system tests
Make t fixture available to both system and unit tests
Document API call
