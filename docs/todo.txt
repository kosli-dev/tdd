# Core
Decide whether to use server-hooks.
   I get [--workers*2] coverage files, on other laptops its [--workers*1]
   Where does this difference come from? No of cores?
   Would it mean the number of workers would have to become an env-var?
   If so, would that be worth it?

Add fields to ScoreForm - allow number of squads to be dynamic
Run unit tests in parallel and run coverage combine
Add some simple system APP tests

# Maybe?
Drop Bundling of JS
Collect coverage of system tests themselves
   Note that this will require coverage on two containers...!
Add separate env-files for unit/system tests
Make t fixture available to both system and unit tests
Document API call
